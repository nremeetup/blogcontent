## Welcome to the NRE Meetup site! 

__What is the NRE Meetup?__

It's a group of people who gather together to discuss, debate and chew on network engineering, automation and orchestration matters. We drink stuff, eat food and share content for the greater good of our abused community.

__How do I join?__

Just come along to a meetup. No membership, no paywall, no guilt-trip.

Check out [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/Network-Reliability-Engineering-Meetup-UK/) for more information on each meet.

__Where are they held?__

We've done one at the time of writing, which was in the most famous brewing town in the UK (Burton on Trent).
They have been chosen to be friendly to Midlanders, but we can move them around depending on audience and travel-kindness to participants. 

__Is there a formal agenda for a meet?__

No, no formal agenda. We ask for anyone willing to share a story, share some tech or just participate in some way to come along.

__Will I be famous?__

No, probably not. If you're thinking about this stuff to do that, then you might be better off in some reality TV show.
