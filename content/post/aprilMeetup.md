Confessions and network reliability engineering, an interesting mix! Alas, Confessions was the name of the venue that hosted the second NRE Meetup. Thanks to everyone that came along and took part in the great discussions.

We spoke at length about Terraform, standardisation of terminology and NRE Labs. 

Takeaways from this session were:

- Do not book these events the day before a national holiday
- NRE is a hot topic, with organisations and individuals looking to move forwards with reliabilty at the core
- Terraform is an interesting proposition for networking

Super short write-up but thanks again to everyone that came along! From left to right:

Until the next time, in the name of reliability we stand!
